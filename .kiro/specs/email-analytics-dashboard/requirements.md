# Requirements Document: Email Analytics Dashboard

## Introduction

The Email Analytics Dashboard is a critical feature that provides users with
comprehensive insights into their email campaign performance. This feature
addresses the current gap in MarkMail's analytics capabilities by providing
real-time metrics on email delivery, engagement, and subscriber behavior. The
dashboard will enable data-driven decision-making, helping users optimize their
email marketing strategies and improve ROI.

   days of data
